##### Notes: 

It actually took me awhile to realize / appreciate the management approach that Yuri took for awhile, and at times didn't realize that I was being managed - often pointed in a direction and given quite a bit of freedom. 

But, some of the discussions that we had and thins that I found helpful

- Pointing me in the right direction - I can get a little scatter shot in my interests (go ADHD), I'd get quite a bit of freedom in jumping around to different things, but eventually get pointed in the right direction
- Helping me talk through what is on my plate / priorities 
- Doing things like
	- List out everything I'm doing
	- What of these things would I like to be doing: more / less / same of
	- Getting me to consider the difference between
		- caring and doing vs caring that it's done
			- Is this something that you care about 
				- and want to do it myself
				- and just want to trust that it's being done
			- Often as someone that can be a bit 'care about all the things', I'd then think it'd be my job to stay ontop of it, or do it myself --- and realizing that "I care about X, someone else is on it" was a good lesson
